HTML & CSS
things i need to add to the index
-- First page --
a button to start 


}

-- Second page--
<div class"hide" id="second">
a div for a timer 
a div for question
a div for result 
</div>

-- Third page--
an form with an input email and submit button

JS:
create a click function for the start button {
add class "hide" to the button
}

on the css file, give the "hide" class a property of display: none

add class "show" and remove class "hide" to the second page divs where id ="second"
on the css file, give the "show" class a property of display: block

Do the same for the third page once you get there

- create an array with multiple question objects
eg: var questionArr = [
    {
    question: "what is the colour of a lion",
    choices: ["blue","green","brown yellow","orange"],
    answer: "brown yellow"
    },
    {
        Other questions, choices, and answer 
    }
]

-create a question index variable which starts with 0 (var x)

- create a function to get the questions: {
//the first question that show up would be the first item in the questionArr array
// var currentQuestion = questionArr[x]
//
}
